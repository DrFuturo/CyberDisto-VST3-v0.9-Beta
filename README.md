# CyberDisto: Distort Reality, Not Just Audio 🤖🎛️

Welcome to the neon-soaked, circuit-fried world of CyberDisto, where your audio gets a one-way ticket to the digital wasteland! 

## 🌆 What is this chrome-plated noise machine?

CyberDisto is not just an audio plugin; it's a cybernetic implant for your DAW. It takes your pristine audio and runs it through a gauntlet of digital destruction, emerging on the other side as something that would make even a malfunctioning AI scratch its virtual head.

## 🔊 Features that'll make your motherboard blush:

- 🔥 Distortion algorithms so hot, they'll melt your CPU's thermal paste
- 🎛️ A filter section that cuts frequencies like a laser through neon fog
- 💾 Lo-Fi effects that'll take your audio back to the future... of the past
- 🦾 "Extra Terra" EQ: Because why settle for earthly tones?
- 🕹️ An XY pad so addictive, you'll forget you're supposed to be making music
- 🧠 Presets that'll make you question the nature of reality (and your mix)

## 💎 Full Version vs. Beta

- 🌟 Full Version: Available exclusively on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/YourPatreonPage). Support the developer and get access to all features!
- 🧪 Beta Version: Available here on GitHub. A taste of the cyber-future, but with limited features.

## 🚀 Installation: Hack the Planet (or just your audio)

1. Download the latest build from our totally-not-suspicious underground data haven (or Patreon for full version)
2. Inject it into your DAW's plugin folder
3. Boot up your rig and pray to the machine spirits
4. Locate CyberDisto in your plugin list (Hint: It's the one causing visual glitches)
5. Slap it on a track and watch your waveforms cry silicon tears

## 🕶️ Usage: Navigating the Digital Wasteland

1. Twist knobs until your ears beg for mercy
2. Abuse the XY pad like it owes you crypto
3. Switch between distortion types faster than a netrunner's neural interface
4. Save presets. Load presets. Question your life choices.
5. Repeat until your mix sounds like it was processed by a sentient vending machine

## 🛠️ Building from Source (For the Brave or Foolish)

1. Clone this repo (at your own risk)
2. Make sure you have JUCE installed (good luck with that)
