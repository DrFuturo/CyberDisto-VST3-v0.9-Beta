## 🌆 What is this chrome-plated noise machine?

CyberDisto is not just an audio plugin; it's a cybernetic implant for your DAW. It takes your pristine audio and runs it through a gauntlet of digital destruction, emerging on the other side as something that would make even a malfunctioning AI scratch its virtual head.

## 🔊 Features that'll make your motherboard blush:

- 🔥 Distortion algorithms so hot, they'll melt your CPU's thermal paste
- 🎛️ A filter section that cuts frequencies like a laser through neon fog
- 💾 Lo-Fi effects that'll take your audio back to the future... of the past
- 🦾 "Extra Terra" EQ: Because why settle for earthly tones?
- 🕹️ An XY pad so addictive, you'll forget you're supposed to be making music
- 🧠 Presets that'll make you question the nature of reality (and your mix)

## 💎 Full Version vs. Beta
- 🌟 Full Version: Available exclusively on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/cyberdisto-vst3-114553758). Support the developer and get access to all features!
- 🧪 Beta Version: Available here on GitHub. A taste of the cyber-future, but with limited features.

## 🚀 Installation: Hack the Planet (or just your audio) - Windows 64-bit only, MacOS version will come later!

### System Requirements
- A 64-bit Windows PC that hasn't achieved sentience (yet)
- 64-bit DAW compatible with VST3 plugins
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit version)
- At least 300MB of RAM (8GB recommended for maximum reality distortion)

### Installation Steps
1. **Download**: 
   - Full Version: Grab the latest 64-bit build from our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/posts/cyberdisto-vst3-114553758).
   - Beta Version: Download the latest 64-bit release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/DrFuturo/CyberDisto-VST3-v0.9-Beta/releases).

2. **Extract**: Unzip the downloaded file to a temporary location. Don't be alarmed if your computer starts speaking in binary.

3. **Install**:
   - Locate the `.vst3` file in the extracted folder.
   - Copy this file to your 64-bit VST3 plugins folder. The standard location is:
     - `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`
   - If your DAW uses a custom VST folder, refer to its documentation for the correct location.

4. **DAW Integration**:
   - Restart your 64-bit DAW if it was open during installation.
   - Most DAWs will scan for new plugins on startup. If not, you may need to manually scan or add the plugin folder in your DAW's preferences.
   - CyberDisto should now appear in your DAW's plugin list under "Effects" or "Distortion".

5. **Start Distorting**: Slap CyberDisto on a track and watch your waveforms cry 64-bit silicon tears.

If you encounter any issues during installation, please reach out to Extra Terra.

Note: 
- CyberDisto is currently available only for 64-bit Windows systems.
- Mac and Linux versions are in development. Stay tuned for updates!

## 🛠️ Building from Source (For the Brave or Foolish)

1. Clone this repo (at your own risk)
2. Make sure you have JUCE installed (good luck with that)
